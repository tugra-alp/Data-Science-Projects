#  Celebrity Face Recognition (End-to-End) : Image Classification with SVM

In this machine learning project, I classify celebrity personalities. I restrict classification to only 5 people. This project includes from data collection **(Image Scrapping)** to Deployment on AWS. Random Forest, Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines algorithm were used for this study, and GridSearchCV method was used for model selection with tuning parameters.

**Choosen People:**
1. Cristiano Ronaldo
2. Cheki Chen
3. Brad Pitt
4. Johnny Depp
5. Lionel Messi

**Here is the folder structure:**
* **UI:** This contains ui website code 
* **server:** Python flask server 
* **model:** Contains python notebook for model building 
* **google_image_scrapping:** Code to scrap google for images 
* **datasets:** Dataset used for our model training which includes celebrity images

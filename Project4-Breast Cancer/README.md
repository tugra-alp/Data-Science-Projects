# Project 4: Breast Cancer : ML Classification Project

Predicting if the cancer diagnosis is **benign** or **malignant** based on several observations/features. Support Vector Classification algorithm used for this study with GridSearchCV method to reach best model parameter.

**30 features are used, examples:**

  - radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
  - texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
  - perimeter
  - area
  - smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
  - compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
  - concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
  - concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
  - symmetry 
  - fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)
Datasets are linearly separable using all 30 input features

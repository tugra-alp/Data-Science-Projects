## [Project 1: Bengaluru House Project : Predict house Prices](https://github.com/tugra-alp/Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/Project1-Bengaluru%20House%20Project)

In this project, I actually try a low-code python module which is LazyPredict to see how it works. LazyPredict is allow us to see which model can fit better, with a few lines code and without any parameter tuning. Thus you get some insight which model or models can fit your data before using these model or models with hyperparameter tuning.
Here is the link of the [LazyPredict Documentation](https://lazypredict.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

- Get the result of regression algorithms in LazyPredict, here is the top 3 models fitted the data:
  1. MLPregressor in Lazypredict =  Adj. R2: 0.87 RMSE: 23.38 
  2. BayesianRidge in Lazypredict = Adj. R2: 0.84 RMSE: 26.65
  3. Linear Regression in Lazypredict = Adj. R2: 0.84 RMSE: 26.67
- Then I used MLP(Multi-Layer Perceptron) algorithms with Sklearn module to train data.
- GridSearchCV was used for tuning.
- Finally, I got the result of the test set
   RMSE :22.45
   R^2 of Tuned Model: 0.902
